# Changelog — `trust-tasks-go`

All notable changes to the Go bindings module.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The module versions over **its own API** — what a consumer compiles against —
not over `SPEC.md`. Below 1.0 a breaking change bumps the leading non-zero
component.

A Go module is published by tagging, so the released version of this module is
the `trust-tasks-go/vX.Y.Z` tag rather than anything in the tree; the `Version`
constant in `trusttasks/version.go` mirrors it. See `RELEASING.md`.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Initial release: generated payload types for every specification in the
  registry, and the hand-written SPEC.md §7.2 consumer pipeline in
  `trusttasks/`.
