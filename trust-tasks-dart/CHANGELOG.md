# Changelog — `trust_tasks`

All notable changes to the Dart bindings package.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The package versions over **its own API** — what a consumer compiles against —
not over `SPEC.md`. Below 1.0 a breaking change bumps the leading non-zero
component.

Publishing is triggered by the `trust-tasks-dart-v<version>` tag, because
pub.dev only accepts an automated publish from a tag-triggered workflow. See
`RELEASING.md`.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Initial release: generated payload types for every specification in the
  registry, and the hand-written SPEC.md §7.2 consumer pipeline in
  `lib/src/runtime/`.
